## Purpose

The purpose of this "question type" plugin is to be used to create a bank of questions for the "SQLab" plugin.
These questions will be retrieved by the "SQLab" plugin from the id of the questionnaire to which
the created questions are associated.
In order to know the id of the questionnaires it is necessary to follow the steps of installation
of the custom questionnaire module, as explained above. The id of the questionnaire can be identified
in the configuration section of the created quiz, under the field that contains the quiz name,
the field can be found as "Quiz id".

## Configuration and Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you can start creating a SQL question from the question bank.
Go to your _Course > Question bank_ and select the option to create a new question.
Choose 'SQL question' from the list of question types.

Once you have started creating a new question you will have to enter information at least within the fields
specified as mandatory, the mandatory fields are marked and all have a help element with additional information
on what their purpose is.

When creating a SQL question, you'll encounter the following fields:

- **Related Concepts**: In this field can be written those concepts to which the exercise is closely related, and that have been previously defined in the Moodle Database modules.

- **Relational Schema**: In this field is stored the schema that contextualize the database for the question.

- **Data**: In this field you can attach the code that must be previously executed for the contextualization of the database for the correct execution of the exercise.

- **SQL check**: In this field you can attach the code that prepares the database environment for testing the trigger. It includes any setups or data necessary to activate the trigger created by the student, such as specific insertions or updates that are expected to be controlled by the trigger.

- **SQL check run**: In this field you can attach the code that executes test operations to evaluate the performance of the trigger created by the student. It should include queries or SQL commands that test the logic of the trigger, ensuring that the system response to these operations is appropriate and as expected.

- **Code**: In this field can be written hints that can be consulted by the students in order to solve the exercise.

- **Result Data**: In this field you must attach the code that will generate the expected tables as a solution, as a sql script.

- **Subjective Difficulty**: In this field is described the subjective difficulty that the teacher has considered for the exercise.

- **Objective Difficulty**: In this field is described the objective difficulty of the exercise.

- **Decrease Attempt**: This field defines the reduction that will be applied to the maximum grade obtainable by the student in a question, each time the student executes a statement.

- **Min Grade**: This field defines the grade from which the reduction per attempt will not continue to be subtracted from the student, for each executed sentence.

- **Solution**: In this field you must attach the solution in code form, as a sql script. It has to be added as a SQL script.
